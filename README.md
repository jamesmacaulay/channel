## Channel

An incomplete implementation of CSP channels in [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/), in the style of [Go](http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#channels) and Clojure's [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async).

This is a personal project for the purposes of better understanding [Erlang/OTP](http://www.erlang.org/doc/)'s process model and its relationship with channel-based CSP.

The [tests](https://github.com/jamesmacaulay/channel/blob/master/test/channel_test.exs) are a good place to start if you want to dig in.
